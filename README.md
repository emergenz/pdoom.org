# pdoom.org

This is the repository of the pdoom.org website. It is a fork of [distillpub/template](https://github.com/distillpub/template).

### Local Development

First, run `npm install` to install all node modules required. If that fails. try `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` (I know, very elegant). Then, run `npm run dev` to start a watching build rollup server. Due to the way we currently deploy (see next section), in order to see your changes, you need to first run `cp examples/* dist/` and then `npm run dev`, i.e. autorefresh doesn't work.

Please note that the `/blog.html` is not automatic yet, so if you add a new blog post, you need to manually add that to `/blog.html`.

### Deployment
Currently, we deploy the `gh-pages` branch, which is the `dist` folder of this branch. To deploy, do `cp examples/* dist/` and then run `git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages` from the main branch. Yes, this is very clunky and has disadvantages, but first ship ðŸš€, then fix.
